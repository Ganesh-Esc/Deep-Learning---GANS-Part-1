A notebook on the theory and implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). You will build and train GANs on both simulated and real-world datasets.

## ðŸ“– Lab Overview

This lab provides a practical guide to understanding and building one of the most innovative ideas in machine learning: **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. We will dive into the original formulation of GANs, which pits two neural networks against each other in a fascinating zero-sum game.

By the end of this exercise, you will have built your own GANs from scratch and used them to generate new, synthetic data that mimics a real dataset. ðŸŽ¨

## ðŸ”¬ Core Concepts: The GAN Framework

GANs consist of two distinct neural networks that are trained simultaneously in a competitive process:

* **The Generator (G):** Think of this network as a forger or an artist. Its job is to take random noise as input and transform it into fake data that looks as realistic as possible. Its goal is to fool the Discriminator.
* **The Discriminator (D):** Think of this network as a detective or an art critic. It is a binary classifier that is trained to distinguish between real data (from the training set) and fake data created by the Generator.

The training process is a constant battle: the **Generator** strives to produce ever-more-convincing fakes, while the **Discriminator** gets better at telling them apart. This adversarial dynamic pushes both networks to improve, ultimately resulting in a Generator that can produce highly realistic, synthetic data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1.  **Understand the Original GAN Formulation:** Clearly explain the roles of the **Generator** and the **Discriminator** and how their adversarial relationship drives the learning process.
2.  **Implement GANs:** Build the two network architectures and, most importantly, the custom training loop that alternates between training the Discriminator and the Generator.
3.  **Train on Simulated Data:** First, train a GAN on a simple, low-dimensional dataset to visualize how the Generator learns the data distribution.
4.  **Train on a Real Dataset:** Apply your knowledge to train a GAN on a real-world image dataset (like MNIST or Fashion-MNIST) to generate novel images.
